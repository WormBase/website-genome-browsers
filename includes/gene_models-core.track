citation = Protein-coding gene structures result from the integration of a variety 
           of prediction methods and data sources followed by manual review and revison 
           by WormBase curators. tRNAs are predicted by tRNAscan, and other non-coding 
           RNA transcripts are taken from a variety of literature sources. 
           The purple and blue colors indicate transcripts on the forward and 
           reverse strands respectively. If sufficient room is available between 
           features, gene models end with a triangle; if not a small arrow is used. 
           For protein-coding genes, only the CDS is represented. Full models 
           (with UTRs) can be seen on the "Coding transcripts" track.
