citation      = This track contains Orfeome Project primer pairs and RACE tags.  These primers were used to amplify
	C. elegans cDNAs.  A positive amplification, shown in green, is evidence that the region
	between the two primers is transcribed.  Failure to amplify, shown in red, suggests
	either that the gene model is incorrect, or that the gene is expressed at very low levels.
	Detailed gene models derived from ORFeome sequencing will be added to this display in
	the future.  See <i>Reboul et al. Nat. Genet. 2003 Apr 7.</i> and
