citation = Protein-coding gene structures result from the integration of a variety 
           of prediction methods and data sources followed by manual review and revision
           by WormBase curators. tRNAs are predicted by tRNAscan, and other non-coding 
           RNA transcripts are taken from a variety of literature sources. 
           The purple and blue colors indicate transcripts on the forward and reverse 
           strands respectively. If sufficient room is available between features, gene 
           models end with a triangle; if not a small arrow is used. 
           The grey areas represent 5' and 3' UTRs of protein-coding transcripts, assigned  
           automatically using the extents of overlapping ESTs and full-length cDNAs. The 
           UTR predictions have not been reviewed by WormBase curators, and some are 
           known to contain artifacts.
