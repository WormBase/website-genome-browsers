html1 = <p style="margin:40px"><b>PLEASE NOTE</b><br />We are in the process of reorganizing the layout and grouping of tracks on the Genome Browser. In addition to standardizing appearance across all species, we seek to 1) emphasize the end result of experiments rather than method or approach; 2) promote high-confidence data over that of lower confidence; 3) remove obsolete data.<p>Further evolution is expected over the next few releases.

               The purple and blue colors indicate transcripts on the forward and 
               reverse strands respectively. If sufficient room is available between 
               features, gene models end with a triangle; if not a small arrow is used.
