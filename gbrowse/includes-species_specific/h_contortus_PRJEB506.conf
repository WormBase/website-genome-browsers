citation     = Gene predictions were produced by WormBase, using the 2007 version of 
               the Ensembl RNASeq gene-building pipeline.
               The purple and blue colors indicate transcripts on the forward and 
               reverse strands respectively. If sufficient room is available between 
               features, gene models end with a triangle; if not a small arrow is used.
