citation = Gene predictions were produced by the WormBase in-house AUGUSTUS 
           pipeline, using cDNA and protein homologies as hints.
           The purple and blue colors indicate transcripts on the forward and 
           reverse strands respectively. If sufficient room is available between 
           features, gene models end with a triangle; if not a small arrow is used.
