citation     = The Initial gene set was provided by the ParaSite Genomics group at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, who used MAKER2 (Holt and Yandell 2011, PMID:22192575) to combine RNASeq data with protein homology evidence to predict gene models. Subsequently, WormBase began manually reviewing and revising gene models as part of topic-based curation across a number of species, and this process continues.
