#include includes/genes-all.track
citation = Protein-coding gene structures result from the integration of a variety 
           of prediction methods and data sources followed by manual review and revison 
           by WormBase curators. tRNAs are predicted by tRNAscan, and other non-coding 
           RNA transcripts are taken from a variety of literature sources. 
           The purple and blue colors indicate transcripts on the forward and 
           reverse strands respectively. If sufficient room is available between 
           features, gene models end with a triangle; if not a small arrow is used. 
           Grey areas represent 5' and 3' UTRs of protein-coding transcripts, assigned  
           automatically using the extents of overlapping ESTs and full-length cDNAs. The 
           UTR predictions have not been reviewed by WormBase curators, and some are 
           known to contain artifacts.

           isolated from Aedes aegypti black-eyed Liverpool strain (LVP) mosquitoes
           10-14 days post infection and rinsed in media 3 times prior to flash freezing.

	   from peritoneally-infected gerbils 13-14 days post-infection (approximately 6-7 
           days after the L3->L4 molt). This developmental stage is characterized by 
           posterior lengthening of the primordial ovaries in females and the single testis
	   in males. These larvae were rinsed with media 3 times and flash frozen prior to
	   RNA isolation.

	   were filled with sperm, and males used in the experiment came from patent infections,
	   therefore were actively mating.

citation = Cufflinks assembled RNASeq from immature microfilariae libraries: Immature B. malayi
	   microfilariae were generated by transplanting gravid adult worms into the peritoneal
	   cavity of uninfected gerbils. The mf were isolated three days later by peritoneal
	   flush, and purified using a lymphocyte separation gradient. They were flash frozen
	   prior to RNA isolation. They were confirmed to lack infectivity for Aedes aegypti
	   black-eyed Liverpool strain (LVP) mosquitoes.

citation = Cufflinks assembled RNASeq from egg and embryo libraries: B. malayi eggs and developing
	   embryos were isolated from 90 adult female worms generated by peritoneal infection of
	   gerbils. Females were repeatedly scored with a razor blade to release the eggs and embryos,
	   and contaminated tissue was manually removed. They were washed 2 times with sterile media
	   in a small Petri dish, transferred to a microfuge tube, centrifuged, and the supernatant
	   was removed prior to flash-freezing. This preparation contained unfertilized eggs,
	   fertilized eggs, embryos and pretzel stages.

	   isolation. They were confirmed to be infective for Aedes aegypti black-eyed Liverpool
