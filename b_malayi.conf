citation = Protein-coding gene structures result from the integration of a variety 
           of prediction methods and data sources followed by manual review and revision
           by WormBase curators. tRNAs are predicted by tRNAscan, and other non-coding 
           RNA transcripts are taken from a variety of literature sources. 
           The purple and blue colors indicate transcripts on the forward and reverse 
           strands respectively. If sufficient room is available between features, gene 
           models end with a triangle; if not a small arrow is used. 
           The grey areas represent 5' and 3' UTRs of protein-coding transcripts, assigned  
           automatically using the extents of overlapping ESTs and full-length cDNAs. The 
           UTR predictions have not been reviewed by WormBase curators, and some are 
           known to contain artifacts.

This developmental stage is characterized by posterior lengthening of the primordial ovaries in females and the single testis in males. These larvae were rinsed with media 3 times and flash frozen prior to RNA isolation.

The mf were isolated three days later by peritoneal flush, and purified using a lymphocyte separation gradient. They were flash frozen prior to RNA isolation. They were confirmed to lack infectivity for Aedes aegypti black-eyed Liverpool strain (LVP) mosquitoes.

Females were repeatedly scored with a razor blade to release the eggs and embryos, and contaminated tissue was manually removed. They were washed 2 times with sterile media in a small Petri dish, transferred to a microfuge tube, centrifuged, and the supernatant was removed prior to flash-freezing. This preparation contained unfertilized eggs, fertilized eggs, embryos and pretzel stages.
