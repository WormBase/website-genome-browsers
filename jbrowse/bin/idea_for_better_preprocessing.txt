Here's the idea:

Rather than getting the AllSpecies.stats file that is generated 
during GBrowse's creation, I could write a script that would read
in the config file (which contains the regex patterns for creating
the GFF "sub-files" for different tracks) and instead just goes
the main GFF file line by line and decides which "sub-file(s)" to write
the line to.  After one pass through the GFF file (which will probably
take a long time) all of the required GFF files will be created.

This will almost certainly be faster than the current process that uses
command line grep to create the files, with one execution of grep per 
needed file (one grep would be faster than a script, but I'm not so sure
two or more would be).  In addition to likely being faster, this has the added
benefit of removing the dependency on GBrowse, which is something I've
been thinking about for a while.
