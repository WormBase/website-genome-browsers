Li et al. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32024662 Where several transcripts are nearly identical, they are represented by a single transcript and the number of transcripts is recorded in the read coverage. Sequencing is from 3' to 5' and randomly terminates, so the 5' end of transcripts is often incomplete. This data represents the best alignment of Nanopore transcripts to the reference genome."
