The purple and blue colors indicate transcripts on the forward and reverse strands respectively. Dark purple areas represent 5' and 3' UTRs of protein-coding transcripts, assigned automatically using the extents of overlapping ESTs and full-length cDNAs. The UTR predictions have not been reviewed by WormBase curators, and some are known to contain artifacts. Grey transcripts represent either non-coding transcripts of protein coding genes or transcripts of non-coding genes."
