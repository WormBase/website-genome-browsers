Here they performed high-coverage whole-genome sequencing of 37 wild isolates of the nematode C. briggsae; SNP calling was done by GATK UnifiedGenotyper. After filtering a total of 2,700,664 sites across all strains were identified, of which 439,139 SNPs had high-quality allele calls in every strain.
