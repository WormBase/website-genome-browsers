Colored areas in the worm image represent approximate regions where adult or late larval expression has been documented via Anatomy Ontology terms.  The strand of the sequence (promoter) region used is indicated by color in the same way as genes, where violet is the forward strand and turqoise is the reverse strand.  Clicking on the glyph image will take you to a detailed view of the expression pattern."
