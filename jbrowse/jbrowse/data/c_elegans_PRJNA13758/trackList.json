The 'RST's' (i.e., RACE Sequence Tags), are 5' reads from cloned RACE products (sequenced as minipools). Sequences are vector trimmed then quality trimmed (SL sequences are not removed from 5' RST's).

Likewise, the first sliding window of 20 nt with average quality score lower than 15 marks the end of good quality sequences.
