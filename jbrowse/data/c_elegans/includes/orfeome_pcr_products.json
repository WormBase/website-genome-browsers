A positive amplification, shown in green, is evidence that the region between the two primers is transcribed.  Failure to amplify, shown in red, suggests either that the gene model is incorrect, or that the gene is expressed at very low levels. Detailed gene models derived from ORFeome sequencing will be added to this display in the future.  See <i>Reboul et al. Nat. Genet. 2003 Apr 7.</i> and <a href='http://worfdb.dfci.harvard.edu' target='_blank'>WORFdb</a> for further information."
