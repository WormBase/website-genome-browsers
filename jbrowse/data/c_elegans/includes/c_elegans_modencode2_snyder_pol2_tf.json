After lysis and sonication, the chromatin was immunoprecipitated with an affinity-purified antibody that recognizes the largest subunit of RNA Polymerase II.  The bound DNA was purified and sequenced in an Illumina GA-2.  A sample of the input DNA was sequenced in parallel.  The ChIP-seq data generated by this experiment was analyzed using the PeakSeq peak-calling algorithm to predict protein binding sites in the C. elegans genome.  General Description We are identifying the DNA binding sites for 300 transcription factors in C. elegans. Each transcription factor gene is tagged with the same GFP fusion protein, permitting validation of the gene's correct spatio-temporal expression pattern in transgenic animals.
