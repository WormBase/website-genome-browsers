Details Synchronized C. elegans from various developmental stages of strain OP228 (a transgenic strain engineered to express a gene fusion between nhr-237 and GFP) were treated with the cross-linking reagent formaldehyde. General Description  We are identifying the DNA binding sites for 300 transcription factors in C. elegans. Each transcription factor gene is tagged with the same GFP fusion protein, permitting validation of the gene's correct spatio-temporal expression pattern in transgenic animals.    "
