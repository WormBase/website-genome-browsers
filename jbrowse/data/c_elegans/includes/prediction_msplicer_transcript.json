'mSplicer' which splices general pre-mRNA (including UTR or coding regions) without assuming the existence of a reading frame (requires transcription start and stop). 2. 'mSplicer-ORF' is optimized for coding regions and requires the knowledge of the translation start and stop. These predictions were generated against regions annotated in WS160.
