Sonicated chromatin was prepared and immunoprecipitated with an affinity-purified polyclonal antibody that recognizes core histone H3.  After whole genome amplification, NimbleGen genomic tiling microarrays were used in two-color hybridization experiments to compare the signal from the input DNA versus the fragments pulled-down in the ChIP.  Normalized log2(ratios) are shown in this track."
