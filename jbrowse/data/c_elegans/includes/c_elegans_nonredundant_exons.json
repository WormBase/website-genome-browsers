            "citation" : "Non-redundant exon creation from 14 stages (Waterston project)</h1> <h2>Details</h2> <p> We aggregated gene models generated from RNA-seq, RTPCR, mass-spec, and confirmed polyA/SL sites from 14 different stages and/or strains to identify the minimum set of non-redundant exons for C. elegans. These were mapped to WS190. </p> <h2>General Description</h2> Using massively parallel sequencing by synthesis methods, we are surveying transcripts from various stages, tissues and conditions of the nematode C. elegans. We use novel statistical approaches to evaluate coverage of annotated features of the genome and of candidate processed transcripts.   We then provide lists of evidence of level of expression per transcript and catalogs of confirmed splice junctions, trans-spliced leader sequences, start sites, end sites, and poly-adenylation tracts for each stage/tissue/condition. <br/><br/> <h2>Protocols</h2> <ol> <li> <b>Other Protocols:</b> <a href='http://wiki.modencode.org/project/index.php?title=Transcript-based_non-redundant_exon_creation:RW:1&oldid=27675'>Transcript-based non-redundant exon creation</a> </li> </ol> <h2> Sample Details </h2> <ol> <li> <b>Animals/Lines:</b> Caenorhabditis elegans </li> </ol> <br /> <h2>Related modENCODE submissions:</h2> <ul> <li><b>DCC-2644</b>: <a href='/submit/public/citation/2644'>RNAseq - 0911 aggregate fourteen stages - sequences, alignments, genelets </a></li> <li><b>DCC-2850</b>: <a href='/submit/public/citation/2850'>Adult spe-9 integrated transcripts from RNA-seq, mRNA/EST, RTPCR, mass-spec, polyA sites, and SLs</a></li> <li><b>DCC-2851</b>: <a href='/submit/public/citation/2851'>Young Adult N2 integrated transcripts from RNA-seq, mRNA/EST, RTPCR, mass-spec, polyA sites, and SLs</a></li> <li><b>DCC-2852</b>: <a href='/submit/public/citation/2852'>dauer daf-2 integrated transcripts from RNA-seq, mRNA/EST, RTPCR, mass-spec, polyA sites, and SLs</a></li> <li><b>DCC-2853</b>: <a href='/submit/public/citation/2853'>dauer entry daf-2 integrated transcripts from RNA-seq, mRNA/EST, RTPCR, mass-spec, polyA sites, and SLs</a></li> <li><b>DCC-2854</b>: <a href='/submit/public/citation/2854'>dauer exit daf-2 integrated transcripts from RNA-seq, mRNA/EST, RTPCR, mass-spec, polyA sites, and SLs</a></li> <li><b>DCC-2855</b>: <a href='/submit/public/citation/2855'>early embryo N2 integrated transcripts from RNA-seq, mRNA/EST, RTPCR, mass-spec, polyA sites, and SLs</a></li> <li><b>DCC-2856</b>: <a href='/submit/public/citation/2856'>embryo him-8 integrated transcripts from RNA-seq, mRNA/EST, RTPCR, mass-spec, polyA sites, and SLs</a></li> <li><b>DCC-2857</b>: <a href='/submit/public/citation/2857'>late embryo N2 integrated transcripts from RNA-seq, mRNA/EST, RTPCR, mass-spec, polyA sites, and SLs</a></li> <li><b>DCC-2858</b>: <a href='/submit/public/citation/2858'>L1 lin-35(n745) integrated transcripts from RNA-seq, mRNA/EST, RTPCR, mass-spec, and wormbase splice junctions</a></li> <li><b>DCC-2859</b>: <a href='/submit/public/citation/2859'>L4 male integrated transcripts from RNA-seq, mRNA/EST, RTPCR, mass-spec, polyA sites, and SLs</a></li> <li><b>DCC-2860</b>: <a href='/submit/public/citation/2860'>L1 N2 integrated transcripts from RNA-seq, mRNA/EST, RTPCR, mass-spec, polyA sites, and SLs</a></li> <li><b>DCC-2861</b>: <a href='/submit/public/citation/2861'>L2 N2 integrated transcripts from RNA-seq, mRNA/EST, RTPCR, mass-spec, polyA sites, and SLs</a></li> <li><b>DCC-2862</b>: <a href='/submit/public/citation/2862'>L3 N2 integrated transcripts from RNA-seq, mRNA/EST, RTPCR, mass-spec, polyA sites, and SLs</a></li> <li><b>DCC-2863</b>: <a href='/submit/public/citation/2863'>L4 N2 integrated transcripts from RNA-seq, mRNA/EST, RTPCR, mass-spec, polyA sites, and SLs</a></li> </ul> <br /> <b>Release Date:</b> 2010-02-18"
