Synchronized L2 larvae from C. elegans strain OP200 (a transgenic strain engineered to express a gene fusion between alr-1 and GFP) were treated with the cross-linking reagent formaldehyde.  After lysis and sonication, the chromatin was immunoprecipitated with an affinity-purified antibody that recognizes GFP.  The bound DNA was purified and sequenced in an Illumina GA-2.  A sample of the input DNA was sequenced in parallel.  The ChIP-seq data generated by this experiment was analyzed using the PeakSeq peak-calling algorithm to predict protein binding sites in the C. elegans genome. "

PeakRanger takes the broad regions and uses second-derivative information to find local summits. We extended each of these summits with a 100 bp flanking each side (if the initial region was smaller than 200 bp we just kept the small region size). The narrow binding regions (maximum 200 bp) around the summit found by PeakRanger were defined as narrow summit peaks.We are identifying the DNA binding sites for 300 transcription factors in C. elegans. Each transcription factor gene is tagged with the same GFP fusion protein, permitting validation of the gene's correct spatio-temporal expression pattern in transgenic animals.
