This is not intended to take the place of the full JBrowse user guide
at 

    http://gmod.org/wiki/JBrowse and 
    http://jbrowse.org/code/JBrowse-1.11.4/docs/tutorial/

but rather is just a few things I'd like to point out for WormBase users.

The current instance of JBrowse can be found at http://jbrowse.wormbase.org/.
When you navigate there, you'll find a somewhat uninspiring page with the 
name of a few species represented in WormBase.  As with everything else, 
the one with the most data is C. elegans (currently both S. ratti and 
C. briggsae just there for me to test some things).

JBrowse is the "next gen" "replacement" for GBrowse.  I put the replacement
in quotes because I don't expect GBrowse to go away any time soon, so really
it's more of a compliment.  JBrowse is designed to be much faster than 
GBrowse and it is generally quite successful in that.  I don't want to go
into the technology that makes it so fast, but if you're curious, you can 
look at the two URLs I gave above or ask me.

Some usage notes:

1. Selecting tracks: JBrowse comes with a faceted track selector.  To
access it, click on the "Select tracks" tab near the upper left corner.
This will slide open the track selector.  The track selector allows users
to select tracks based on metadata provided about the tracks.  In the 
current instance, that means the track names, categories (which are the
same as in GBrowse) and citation (that is, description text about the track).
Tracks can be selected in a variety of ways, including clicking on categories
on the left or using the search field in the upper right section of the
selector to dynamically search all metadata of the tracks.  Turning on tracks
then can be accomplished either by clicking individual checkboxes next to the
track names or by clicking the checkbox next to the "Name" header of the table
to turn them all on.  Note that there is currently a limit of 30 tracks that
you can turn on at once by clicking on the "Name" checkbox, but you can have
more than 30 tracks in JBrowse at once.

2. Navigation: One of the big selling points of JBrowse is fast and fluid
panning and zooming.  Generally you get around JBrowse the same way as
GBrowse: there are pan, zoom in and out buttons (the big magnifying glasses
zoom "a lot" and the little ones zoom "a little").  In addition to using
the buttons, you can pan by clicking and dragging the mouse in any
empty space in the tracks.  You can also zoom in a way that is similar to
GBrowse, by clicking and dragging to highlight the region to zoom to and
release it.  You can do that either on the chromosome ruler (above the
navigation buttons) or on the region ruler (below the navigation buttons).

3. Searching: in the current implementation, searching is less than ideal.
You can't search for alias or gene name but you can search for sequence
names (that is, you can't search for unc-1 but you can look for K03E6.5.
I'm working on a fix for that.

4. Using your own data: JBrowse let's you load BAM or BigWig data but it 
works differently from GBrowse.  In GBrowse, when you want to load your 
own data, you upload it to a server which processes the data and sends
images back.  With JBrowse, the files are kept locally and processed
by the JavaScript code in the browser.  To load your own data files, use
the Open option in the File menu in the upper left corner of the JBrowse
window.

5. Combination tracks: Also under that File menu is the "Add combination
track" menu. This is a fairly powerful function that lets you combine the
results in two tracks using a variety of logical operations as well as 
allowing one track to be used as a mask for another track.  To use it
you select that option from the menu and then using the track labels on
the left side of the track, drag the tracks you want to combine into 
the combination track region.  After you drag the second track in,
a window will open with options for how to combine the tracks.

6. Sequence searching: JBrowse has a way to search for short nucleotide
sequences, though it works a little differently from how it used to work
with GBrowse.  To look for the sequence of interest, select the "Add
sequence search track" from the File menu and it will open a window
asking for the sequence (DNA or amino acid, which it searches for by 
translating the reference sequence) as well as items like ignore case 
and limiting to one strand.  Additionally, you can provide a regular
expression to search for, so you could search for something like this
"at[gc]" and it would search for either "atg" or "atc".  It doesn't 
know about IUPAC codes.  It also won't tell you about other places
in the genome that the sequence might exist, it will only draw a glyph
where the sequence is found in the current display.

7. Available data: Currently there are about 50 tracks but I will continue
to add more.  If there is data you'd particularly like to see, please let 
me know and I'll get it in as soon as possible.
