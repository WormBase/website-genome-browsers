This is not intended to take the place of the full JBrowse user guide
at 

    http://gmod.org/wiki/JBrowse and 
    http://jbrowse.org/code/JBrowse-1.11.4/docs/tutorial/

but rather is just a few things I'd like to point out for WormBase users.

The current instance of JBrowse can be found at http://jbrowse.wormbase.org/.
When you navigate there, you'll find a somewhat uninspiring page with the 
name of a few species represented in WormBase.  As with everything else, 
the one with the most data is C. elegans (currently both S. ratti and 
C. briggsae just there for me to test some things).

JBrowse is the "next gen" "replacement" for GBrowse.  I put the replacement
in quotes because I don't expect GBrowse to go away any time soon, so really
it's more of a compliment.  JBrowse is designed to be much faster than 
GBrowse and it is generally quite successful in that.  I don't want to go
into the technology that makes it so fast, but if you're curious, you can 
look at the two URLs I gave above or ask me.

Some usage notes:

1. Selecting tracks: JBrowse comes with a faceted track selector.  To
access it, click on the "Select tracks" tab near the upper left corner.
This will slide open the track selector.  The track selector allows users
to select tracks based on metadata provided about the tracks.  In the 
current instance, that means the track names, categories (which are the
same as in GBrowse) and citation (that is, description text about the track).
Tracks can be selected in a variety of ways, including clicking on categories
on the left or using the search field in the upper right section of the
selector to dynamically search all metadata of the tracks.  Turning on tracks
then can be accomplished either by clicking individual checkboxes next to the
track names or by clicking the checkbox next to the "Name" header of the table
to turn them all on.  Note that there is currently a limit of 30 tracks that
you can turn on at once by clicking on the "Name" checkbox, but you can have
more than 30 tracks in JBrowse at once.
