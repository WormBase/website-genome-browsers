      "description": "This track shows C. briggsae SNPs from the Cutter Lab (University of Toronto). Here they performed high-coverage whole-genome sequencing of 37 wild isolates of the nematode C. briggsae; SNP calling was done by GATK UnifiedGenotyper. After filtering a total of 2,700,664 sites across all strains were identified, of which 439,139 SNPs had high-quality allele calls in every strain. (WBPaper00046558) Thomas CG et al.
