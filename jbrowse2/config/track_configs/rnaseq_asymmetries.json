This asymmetrical signal has been found empirically to be a sensitive marker for the ends of transcripts. Green boxes indicate regions where there are more than 2 times as many reverse sense RNASeq reads aligned to the genome as forward sense reads. This asymmetrical signal has been found empirically to be sensitive marker for the ends of transcripts. The height of all boxes indicates the relative score of the feature.",
