citation     = Gene predictions described in Dieterich C. et al (PUBMED:18806794), 
               submitted to WormBase by the authors. A small number of models have 
               been revised by WormBase curators. 
               The purple and blue colors indicate transcripts on the forward and 
               reverse strands respectively. If sufficient room is available between 
               features, gene models end with a triangle; if not a small arrow is used.
