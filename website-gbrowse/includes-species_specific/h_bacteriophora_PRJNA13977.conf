citation     = Gene predictions submitted to WormBase by Xiaodong Bai (described in
               Bai X. et al, manuscript submitted).
               The purple and blue colors indicate transcripts on the forward and 
               reverse strands respectively. If sufficient room is available between 
               features, gene models end with a triangle; if not a small arrow is used.
